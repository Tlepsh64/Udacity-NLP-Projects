# Udacity-NLP-Projects
This is a collection of introductory projects that are related to the natural language processing nanodegree given by Udacity.

As of now, it only includes the hidden markov model project for part-of-speech tagging. The other two, namely machine translation model(with and without attention) and speech recognizer, are not included unfortunately. This is due to time constraints, since I had only 2 months to finish the whole nanodegree during the COVID-19 pandemic last summer.
